- Developed Alternating Least Squares recommender system for the MovieLens 100k dataset, encoded with user, item, rating, and additional meta-data, to output a user-item matrix.
- Employed the vectorized form of user-user and item-item collaborative filtering algorithms, along with baseline algorithms like popularity and user average rating for the development of the recommender system.
- After tuning Rank, MaxIter, Alpha and regularization parameter, best RMSE was 1.113 for a train test split of 7:3
- Got top 10 movie recommendations for several users IDs.
